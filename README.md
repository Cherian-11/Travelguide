Project Title:
Kerala Travel in Frames – A District-Wise Travel Guide Website
Background & Context:
Tourism in Kerala, popularly known as "God’s Own Country", plays a pivotal role in the state's economy and cultural promotion. While Kerala attracts millions of tourists each year, travelers often face challenges in accessing district-specific, authentic, and clutter-free travel information. Existing platforms tend to be either too generic or overloaded with ads, leading to a poor user experience. This project aims to bridge that gap by developing a responsive, well-organized travel guide website for Kerala’s 14 districts.
Problem Statement:
Travelers lack a centralized, clean, and accessible platform that provides reliable information about each district in Kerala, including tourist attractions, cuisine, transportation, and emergency contacts. Current platforms are cluttered, lack localization, or fail to provide a streamlined planning experience.
Objectives:
•	To design and build a responsive front-end travel guide using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
•	To present district-specific information such as tourist attractions, local cuisine, transport facilities, and emergency contact details.
•	To improve the user interface and experience with smooth navigation and mobile responsiveness.
•	To integrate a subscription feature using Firebase Firestore for collecting user email data.
•	To enhance the web development skills of the team through real-world application and teamwork.
Project Description:
The website features:
•	A Welcome Page with visuals and a subscribe option that stores user email data in Firebase.
•	A Homepage introducing Kerala and linking to each of the 14 district-specific pages.
•	Individual District Pages highlighting:
o	Tourist attractions with images and descriptions
o	Local cuisines
o	Transportation guidance
o	Emergency contact numbers
The project uses Firebase for real-time database integration and GitHub Pages for hosting the live website.
Technology Stack:
•	Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
•	Backend/Database: Firebase (Firestore)
•	Development Tools: Visual Studio Code, Web Browsers for testing
•	Version Control & Hosting: GitHub
Expected Outcomes:
•	A fully functional and visually appealing travel guide website.
•	Simplified and centralized access to district-wise travel data for Kerala.
•	A real-world example of using front-end technologies and Firebase integration.
•	Enhanced skills in web design, UI/UX, and collaborative development.
Team Details:
Project executed by a 7-member student team from St. Joseph’s College of Engineering and Technology, Palai under the name CRAFT, as part of the IBM SkillBuild initiative.
